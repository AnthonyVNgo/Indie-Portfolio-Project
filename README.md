# Portfolio - README
A static protfolio website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for me to showcase some of my past works and for users to view and connect with me.

## Inspiration
I wanted to work on a completely independent project while also learning how to incorporate Tailwind css, so I decided to kill two birds with one stone with this project.

I referenced [Ty Finck's demo website](https://demos.tyfromtheinternet.com/portfolio/) for design.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Tailwind
